# PCA Covid 19 TFG
My BSc final thesis uses Principal Components Analysis to determine significant variables in the evolution of the Covid 19 pandemic.

## Abstract:

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges that society has faced in modern times. The pandemic has had a huge impact on our lives, affecting the global economy, education, employment, and mental health. To cope with the pandemic, many countries have implemented social distancing measures and business closures, leading to a global economic crisis. In this context, a large number of variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been collected, from the number of cases and deaths to government measures, mobility data from our devices and the availability of medical resources and vaccines.

The present work focuses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and its theoretical development. In addition, we aim to develop a web application that implements the PCA method, allowing users to apply it to different temporal ranges, making easier the analysis of the pandemicâ€™s different waves.
